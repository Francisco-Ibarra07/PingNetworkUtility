TODO:
DONE - Add option to set ping rate
DONE - Add argument parsing
DONE - use usleep instead of sleep()
DONE - Make timeout value a option arg
DONE - have a 'exit' flag that makes the program exit if there is one packet loss
DONE - Add timeout to recvfrom and print out a ping message saying it failed
DONE - if verbose flag, print out src ip, ttl value, sleep value, etc.
DONE - add avg/min/max times at the end of ping command
DONE - Incorporate the arg TTL (rn its not doing anythin)
DONE - Detect packet loss 
DONE - Add option to set TTL and detect TTL timout in recvfrom. Need to read the code of returned icmp
DONE - Increment icmp seq number
DONE - Look up how to handle errors properly in c
DONE - either exit(1) or exit(EXIT_FAILURE)
DONE - fix the 'success' on errno perror exit
DONE - Show error message when destination is not reachable
DONE - change 'user_input' to something else
DONE- Show error when host DNE
DONE - Done use strcp()
- Look at ping statistic data types and see if it should be float or unsigned long or uintdefined
- change -e to be exit on error instead of exit on timeout

Steps to complete project:

	DONE - 1) Make a C file that accepts a hostname or IP in the first argument

	DONE - 2) Send ICMP 8 ('echo request') in an infinite loop to the passed in argument
		- ICMP packet goes in the 'data' part of a the IP header

	DONE - 2.5) Print the messages nicely formatted

	DONE - 3) Read all ICMP 0 ('echo reply')
		DONE - Calculate Round Trip Time (RTT) from this reply
	- Print out any packet loss 
	- Setup a timeout for recvfrom

	DONE - 3.5) Make echo in an infinite loop

	DONE 4) Clean up code
		- consistent perror messages
		- either use puts or printf
		- split stuff into functions?
		- rename vars
		
	5) Do some of the extra credit features?
		DONE - Do an option to set the ping rate (in seconds)

Video notes:
- 1:07:30
	- destination host unreachable: 
		- You have recieved it here and ip addresses but unreachable
		- if you get this then that is how you can printf an error message
- 1:10:20
	- ICMP is made up of:
		Type
		Code
		First 8 bytes of IP datagram causing the error

	- ICMP Format
