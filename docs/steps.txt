Solution steps:
	From link #1
	- Use hostent getHostByName() to check if host exists
	- If it does, get info and place it in sockaddr_in variable

	From link #2:
	- Create a datagram buffer with iphdr and icmp header
	- use sendto() to send over the data


Once done, do the other steps below

Steps to complete project:

	1) Make a C file that accepts a hostname or IP in the first argument

	2) Send ICMP 8 ('echo request') in an infinite loop to the passed in argument
		- ICMP packet goes in the 'data' part of a the IP header

	3) Read all ICMP 0 ('echo reply')
	- Calculate Round Trip Time (RTT) from this reply
	- Print out any packet loss 

	4) Write unit test cases and hand those in too

	5) Do some of the extra credit features?
		- do signal sigint handler

Video notes:
- 1:07:30
	- destination host unreachable: 
		- You have recieved it here and ip addresses but unreachable
		- if you get this then that is how you can printf an error message
- 1:10:20
	- ICMP is made up of:
		Type
		Code
		First 8 bytes of IP datagram causing the error

	- ICMP Format
