Once done, do the other steps below

Steps to complete project:

	DONE - 1) Make a C file that accepts a hostname or IP in the first argument

	DONE - 2) Send ICMP 8 ('echo request') in an infinite loop to the passed in argument
		- ICMP packet goes in the 'data' part of a the IP header

	2.5) Print the messages nicely formatted

	3) Read all ICMP 0 ('echo reply')
	- Calculate Round Trip Time (RTT) from this reply
	- Print out any packet loss 
	- Setup a timeout for recvfrom

	DONE - 3.5) Make echo in an infinite loop

	4.0) Clean up code
		- consistent perror messages
		- either use puts or printf
		- split stuff into functions?
		- rename vars
		
	4) Write unit test cases and hand those in too

	5) Do some of the extra credit features?
		- Do an option to set the ping rate (in seconds)
		- fancy stuff like read code of response ip packet

Video notes:
- 1:07:30
	- destination host unreachable: 
		- You have recieved it here and ip addresses but unreachable
		- if you get this then that is how you can printf an error message
- 1:10:20
	- ICMP is made up of:
		Type
		Code
		First 8 bytes of IP datagram causing the error

	- ICMP Format
